# HealthCare_sepsis_and_septic_shock

Sepsis is an organ failure disease caused by an infection resulting in extremely high mortality.

Sepsis is a serious condition in which the body responds improperly to an infection.

The infection-fighting processes turn on the body, causing the organs to work poorly.

Sepsis may progress to septic shock. This is a dramatic drop in blood pressure that 
can damage the lungs,kidneys, liver and other vital organs. 

When the damage is severe, it can lead to mortality.
